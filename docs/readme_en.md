## Basic information
Miniweb is a simple web application framework designed for microchips (primary ESP8266 and possibly ESP32) with an emphasis on performance. It was created as a Bachelor's thesis, but will be further developed.

## Third party used libraries
**Attention: The framework runs on micropython version 1.13!**
 - uasyncio
 - micropython-logging
 - micropip
 - ujson

## Requirements
1. [Download micropip](https://pypi.org/project/micropython-upip/)
*Note: Download the following libraries via micropip (also upip)*
2. [Download asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/micropython-uasyncio/)
3. [Download micropython-logging](https://pypi.org/project/micropython-logging/)


## API

### Route

It is defined through the decorator. It contains 4 universal functions and one general - *get()*, *post()*, *put()*, *delete()* and *route()*. For general, it is necessary to define an HTTP method (or more HTTP methods).
The required parameter for all is the path. An optional parameter is the **controller**, which can clusters routes into groups. Another optional parameter is **consumes**, which defines the array of acceptable incoming Content-Type.

```python
import miniweb

app = miniweb.miniweb()

@app.route("/foo", [Method.GET, Method.POST])
def foo(req, res):
   pass

@app.get("/bar")
def bar(req, res):
   pass
``` 

**Route can work with query parameters and also with path parameters**. More in the examples.
- [example of path parameters](../examples/path_param_example.py)
- [example of query parameters](../examples/query_param_example.py)
- [example of using controller inside of route](../examples/controller_example.py)
- [example of defining HTTP response](../examples/http_response_example.py)
- [example of using consumes inside of route](../examples/consumes_example.py)

#### Request
From the request it is possible to access headers, query parameters, or content from the body of the request. The request can process Json and Form Data into an object to make it easy for developers to use. If the miniweb does not know the incoming content-type, the data is only accessible as a String.
```python
    query_parameter_key = request.params["key"]
    request_content = request.content
    
    #its possible to access through the keys if content is json
    json_key_id = request.content["id"]
    
    #if content is multipart/form-data, then its accesed via object attributes
    file = request.content.file
    value = request.content.value
    multilinevalue = request.content.multilinevalue
    
    #access to headers
    headers = request.headers
    content_type = headers["Content-Type"]
``` 

#### Response
For response, it is possible to define the status, content-type and the entity itself. Everything happens through the builder. When the Response is final, the *build()* method must be used
```python
from miniweb import Status, Mime
    Response().status(Status.OK).type(Mime.HTML).entity("<h1>Ahoj, svÄ›te!</h1>").build()
``` 

### Static routers
Static routers are used to manage the serving of static files on the server. More can be defined. They accept two mandatory parameters - **root**, **path** and one optional parameter- **controller**. The **root** parameter defines which folder on the device you are using is the default (for example, "/var/www"). The parameter **path**, on the other hand, defines a kind of alias under which the given root path will be entered in the endpoint *(for example we have root "/var/www/subfolder/" and path "/file/", when we enter "/file/index.html", then the file "/var/www/subfolder/index.html")* is returned.
```python
from miniweb import miniweb
    app = miniweb()
    
    app.static_router(root="/var/www/", path="/file/")
``` 

As with regular routes, global middleware functions and possibly also middleware functions of the given controller are applied to Static routers. More in the example:
- [example of static router](../examples/static_route_example.py)

### Middleware function
It is defined through decorators. It contains one optional parameter - **controller**. Middleware functions are functions that are performed before the actual execution of the route function, used for control and protection. If they do not have a controller, then they are called before all routes, for controllers, on the contrary, only for routes that belong to the controller.

```python
from miniweb import filter

@filter()
def middleware(req, res):
    return True
    
@filter(userController)
def is_logged(req, res):
    return False
``` 

### Controllers
Controllers are used to collect routes into groups. Their path is defined. The resulting route with controller * is controller_path + route_path *. In addition to the path prefix, it is also used to define middleware functions just for controllers.
```python
from miniweb import Controller, miniweb

app = miniweb()
user_controller = Controller("/user")

@app.get("/id", controller=user_controller)
def get_user_id(req, res):
    #path is "/user/id"
    pass
``` 
### Configuration
It can be configured in two ways - in the code via the constructor or via the configuration file. If both variants are filled in, parameterization through the constructor takes precedence. When configuring via a file, it is necessary that the defined file has an extension *.env*.
```python
from miniweb import miniweb, Log

params = {
    "port": 8000,
    "log": Log.DEBUG,
    "host": "localhost"
}

app = miniweb(params)

``` 
This example describes the first method, the following will be from the second, inside the *.env* file.
```bash
#config.env file
port=8000
log=DEBUG
host=127.0.0.1
``` 
The log level is specified by the String and all letters must be uppercase.

### Enums
Miniweb uses enumerators for Log, HTTP methods, Mime types and HTTP statuses. It is also possible to state exact values.
```python
 #instead of Log.DEBUG you can write 10
 params = {
     "log": 10
 }
 
 #instead of Mime.JSON you can enter "application / json"
 #This same applies to Statuses, instead of Status.OK can be expressed by code numbers - 200
 }
```
